# Senior-Project-F22
Senior project git repository.

## Project Description
The project's goal is to build a Web application that provides both music
recommendations and social features. The application will rely on resources
made available by Spotify and will be built using the Django Web framework.

The social concept of the system is to introduce its users to new people and
new music. By providing friend and music suggestions to the user, the system
will initiate conversations.
